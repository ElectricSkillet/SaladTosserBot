# SaladTosserBot
A simple Python script that talks out its ass and constantly tosses word salad. Currently running as a Telegram bot at t.me/SaladTosserBot

The script provided herein can be run locally. For use on Telegram it needs to be wrapped in a bot script that contains the basic commands and handles input/output.

Pull requests are welcome. Entries based on actual tweets from the meatspace alter ego of this bot are preferred.
